# LZ1AQ Loop Controller üïπÔ∏è

I wanted to build a fully remotable LZ1AQ Active Antenna controller with off the shelf components. It is very cheap to buy ESP8266 MCUs and multi-channel relay boards online. Why reinvent the wheel? This project can be easily adapted to control remote antenna switches and other devices that can be controlled with relays.

## BOM

| Part Number | Description | QTY |
|---|---|---|
| NodeMCU V2 | Microcontroller with ESP8266 | 1 |
| N/A | 4 Channel Relay Module (Active Low) | 1 |
| RM2055M | Hammond Enclosure (50 mm x 140 mm x 190 mm) | 1 |
| HC-6 | Adhesive PCB Supports | 8 |
| BK/HTB-24M-R | Fuse Holder 5mm x 20mm	| 1 |
| 5MF 300-R	| Fuse 300 mA 5mm x 20mm| 10 |
| N/A | DC Connector of your choice | 1 |
| N/A |Panel Mount Micro USB Extension | 1 |
| PGSD-8 | Cable Grommet |
| N/A | Hookup Wire | |
| N/A | Dupont Jumpers Wires | |

I used PC Motherboard standoffs and screws to rest the power inserter in the enclosure. It is not mounted permanently to allow easy removal of the front panel.

## LZ1AQ Documentation

1 0 0 Loop A  
0 1 0 Loop B  
1 1 0 A + B  
0 0 1 Vertical  

**Note: My code has pin 1 inverted so Loop A is in the Normally Closed position. This allows the loop to function in A mode with no power applied to the MCU or relay board.**
